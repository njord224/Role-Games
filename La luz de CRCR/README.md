I'm planning on creating a live role playing game for 8 people, I would like the game to be divided in two acts, giving them the chance for the characters to have some development and then a final act where different missions should be carried over by the players maybe having two teams?

I'm the only one guiding/mastering the game so it would be nice having a "higher been" keeping an eye on his worshipers, maybe something like a leader/deity. From a players point of view, would be nice having 2 or 3 types?

- One leader
- 2 right hands
- 4 members of the group
- 1 newly arrived member

The group itself is a really religious group with fix rules and ideals, they are really really REALLY greatful for the good deeds of others in the group and are always praising their lord when possible.

The players are all living in a shared house where they do everything together the location is still to be determined so please keep it as {CIUDAD}, the name of the group is still to be determined as well so please keep it as {GRUPO}, and the name of their lord the same {LORD}.

A quick summary of the plot I had in mind is having the players getting ready for the greaaaaat ceremony where they will all enjoy the biggest and greatest food and drinks there are. All the members are super interested in going to this dinner/ceremony but one of them knows things that are quite disturbing and believes this is no good as they might be going to die in the ceremony, so said player can try and save people in the house. However going against the group may imply a punishment to that player and can get him/herself killed by the members of the group.

I would like to introduce a romance/love story in the plot, I would also like to add some treason, mistery, and comedy. Considering there are 8 people playing there are many interactions that can happend, so can you please draft a main MD file where the main story is written in, then a separate MD file for each of the players where they are given their background for the character and their main goal for the game?

The players are spanish so please do everything in spanish.
